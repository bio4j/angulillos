  ## Elements

  This is a base interface for both [Vertices](TypedVertex.java.md) and [Edges](TypedEdge.java.md); it only has that which is common to both:

  1. a reference to its [type](#Element_types) `ET`
  2. methods for [properties](Property.java.md)
  3. a reference to the [graph](TypedGraph.java.md) `G` of which they are elements.

  #### elements and their types

  `E` refers to the element itself, and `ET` its type. You cannot define one without defining the other.

  /* The type of this element */

  /* An abstract reference to the instance of the implementing class. This should return `this` in all cases; it just cannot be implemented at this level. */

  /* `raw` should return a reference to the instance of the corresponding raw type underlying this element. The return type should be `RV + RE` but Java does not have sum types, and it will collapse anyway at the level of Vertex and Edge so `Object` is not that bad here. */
  ER raw();

  /* The graph in which this element lives. */
  G graph();

  /* The `get` method lets you get the value of a `property` which this element has. For that, you pass as an argument the [property](Property.java.md). Note that the type bounds only allow properties of this element. */
