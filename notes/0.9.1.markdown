**IMPORTANT** everyone should update to this release, after #86, which fixes arities for edges being mixed up. This bug affects the interval [0.7.0, 0.9.0].

Apart from that:

- a convenience edge class has been added to typed graphs, letting you easily declare edges between two different graphs.
- internal code cleanup, build definition, pullapprove etc. All this does not affect library users in any way.
