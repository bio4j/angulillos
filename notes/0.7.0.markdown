**IMPORTANT** *This version is affected from #86. Update to [0.9.1](https://github.com/bio4j/angulillos/releases/tag/v0.9.0).*

* A lot of general code refactoring (most of it in #62):
    - Setters return the subject for chaining calls
    - Added arity-specific methods in/out-E/V methods with default implementations
    - Moved all the methods from TypedGraph to the elements interfaces
    - Split Arity on two: From/To; Added FromArity to Property
    - Added Unique and NonUnique Property types to fix the arity
    - Added vertex/edge types list to the typed graph and properties list to each typed element
    - Added UntypedGraphSchema interface for automatic schema creation
* See also #46, #51
