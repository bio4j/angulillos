# Angulillos

Angulillos is a Java 8 library for working with strongly typed graph data in a generic way. You write graph schemas using the Java type system, with graph traversals being statically checked over graph schemas. The same schemas and traversals can then be used with any graph technology implementing the Angulillos API.
